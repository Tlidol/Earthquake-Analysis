# Earthquake-Analysis
Gathered, prepared, and used data scraped by myself from National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC). Including the date, time, location, depth, magnitude, and source of every earthquake with a reported magnitude 5.5 or higher from 1965 to 2016.
Utilized Python and Jupyter notebooks to create codelook at historical earthquake data to determine if correlations or differences in statistical means exist between locations, depths, and magnitudes.
Purpose: To provide insight into future prediction and risks.
